<p class ="start">Biography:
     Born February 9, 1987, Michael B. Jordan was raised in Newark, New Jersey, where he got his start as a model and actor. His first significant break was an appearance on The Sopranos in 1999 and in "The Wire". 
        He later landed major roles in landmark TV shows like The Wire and Friday Night Lights. Jordan garnered acclaim for his role in the film festival favorite Fruitvale Station (2013) and for his role as a boxing protégé in 2015's Creed. He returned to the big screen in early 2018 in the wildly successful Marvel superhero flick Black Panther.</p>

<p class = "summary">
        Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) never knew his famous father, boxing champion Apollo Creed, who died before Adonis was born. However, boxing is in his blood, so he seeks out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and 
        asks the retired champ to be his trainer. Rocky sees much of Apollo in Adonis, and agrees to mentor him, even as he battles an opponent deadlier than any in the ring. With Rocky's help, Adonis soon gets a title shot, but whether he has the true heart of a fighter remains to be seen.

<p class = "summary">While life is good with that victory and his marriage to Bianca, trouble 
    comes to Philadelphia when Ivan Drago, the Russian boxer who killed Adonis' father, Apollo, arrives with his son, Viktor, to challenge Adonis. Against Rocky's advice, Adonis accepts the challenge without his mentor's participation and pays the price in a punishing bout he wins only by a technicality.
      Meanwhile, the Drago family have its own 
     troubles trying to regain the respect in their homeland that they lost at Rocky's hands as they wonder whether is it truly worth it.

Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.</p>
